To use start by either placing your inventory data as described or press the warning symbol next to the auth token field to get your inventory data.

After setting the correct auth token your data should be able to be updated as configured on the right side.

The "Update Game Data" button is specifically for warframe version updates which will automatically request the public export data from Digital Extremes and updates the items to the newest version.

Be careful before downloading and or using this to read all disclaimers, like this one:
